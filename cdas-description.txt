Crowd Detecting and Alerting System

The Crowd Detecting and Alert System is an IoT-based solution designed to monitor and control the number of people present in a specific area. 
The system uses infrared (IR) sensors placed at entry and exit points to detect human movement. 
Based on the sensor inputs, the ESP8266 microcontroller updates the occupancy count in real time.

When the number of people exceeds a predefined limit, the system activates a red LED and buzzer to indicate overcrowding. 
If the occupancy remains within safe limits, a green LED glows to indicate availability. 
A push button is provided to reset the count when required.

The system is integrated with the Blynk IoT platform, enabling remote monitoring through a mobile application. 
The live crowd count is displayed using gauge and label widgets, while LED widgets indicate the occupancy status. 
This cloud connectivity allows administrators to monitor crowd levels from anywhere, ensuring safety and effective space management.

Overall, the system provides an efficient, low-cost, and reliable solution for automatic crowd monitoring and alert generation in environments such as classrooms, halls, offices, and public spaces.
