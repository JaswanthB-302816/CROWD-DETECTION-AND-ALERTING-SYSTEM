# CROWD-DETECTION-AND-ALERTING-SYSTEM
Crowd Detecting and Alert System is an IoT-based solution that uses IR sensors and an ESP8266 to count people entering and exiting an area. When occupancy exceeds a set limit, LEDs and a buzzer provide alerts, while live data is monitored remotely through the Blynk platform for safe crowd management.
